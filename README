# Snakemake Examples

This repository contains a collection of Snakemake workflow examples that demonstrate key features and capabilities for building reproducible, scalable pipelines.

Each subdirectory showcases a specific concept or pattern using minimal, educational examples. These examples are designed to help users learn Snakemake and adopt best practices in scientific computing.

## üìÅ Example Workflows

### `01_linear_workflow/`
A simple three-step linear workflow that transforms text using shell commands. Demonstrates basic rule chaining and file-based dependencies.

### `02_fan_in_fan_out_workflow/`
A more complex hierarchical workflow:
- Splits a dataset into chunks
- Subsplits each chunk
- Processes subchunks in parallel
- Merges results at two levels  
Illustrates fan-in/fan-out patterns and scalable parallelism.

### `03_pixi_environments/`
Uses [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/pixi) to define **per-rule isolated environments**.
- Demonstrates how to integrate Snakemake with Pixi
- Shows multiple environment reproducibility using `pixi.toml` files

### `04_slurm_cluster/`
A simple example of running jobs on a SLURM cluster.
- Includes SLURM jobscript and configuration
- Demonstrates scalable job submission using wildcards
- This one can't be run simply, it's meant to serve as an example.

## üõ† Requirements

- [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/docs/pixi/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

- Install Pixi
- In each directory, typing "pixi run example" will run the example from start to finish.
- Running "pixi run dag" which create the graph visualization of the workflow.
